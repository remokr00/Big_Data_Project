# Big_Data_Project

This project was developed to pass the Big Data Models and Techniques exam. The task was to perform aggregated 
queries on a social network modeled through a graph. The technology used is Apache Spark.

This direcotries contain the backend code of the application. Make sure, if you want to run it, to change the
path in the "Application.scala" file to make sure that the dataset will be uploaded correctly.

You can find the 3 files which form the dataset at this link:

I suggest to reduce the dataset, in "Gestore" you will find the code that I used to create my own reduced dataset. 
To create the new DataSet it will take 1 hour (Mac M1 8GB).
